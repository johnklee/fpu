  Alias class that can be used as a decorator for making methods callable

  For example, if you want to make the method shout() be also callable as
  yell() and scream(), you can use alias like this:

  Decorator function that *must* be used in combination with @alias

  seeking for those which have an '_aliases' attribute and then defines new
  members in the class using those aliases as mere pointer functions to the
  original ones.

    @aliased
    class MyClass(object):
      @alias('coolMethod', 'myKinkyMethod')

    i = MyClass()
