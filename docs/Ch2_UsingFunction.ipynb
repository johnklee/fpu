    "# <font color='darkblue'>What is a function?</font>\n",
    "<b>A function is generally known as a mathematical object, although the concept is also ubiquitous in everyday life</b>. Unfortunately, in everyday life, we often confuse functions and effects. And what is even more unfortunate is that we also make this mistake when working with many programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='darkgreen'>Functions in the real world</font>\n",
    "In the real world, a function is primarily a mathematic concept. It’s a relation between a source set, called the function domain, to a target set, called the function codomain. The domain and the codomain need not be distinct. A function can have the same set of integer numbers for its domain and its codomain, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3'>What makes a relation between two sets a function</font></b><br/>\n",
    "To be a function, a relation must fulfill one condition: all elements of the domain must have one and only one corresponding element in the codomain, as shown in below figure:\n",
    "<img src='https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSfVsuKVXcE/Wfm5yJnJhYI/AAAAAAAAXCA/Gq5Q_jjdK9wik1LJjYoy3f1ALYomLrcYgCLcBGAs/s1600/4070_f2-1.PNG'/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This has some interesting implications: \n",
    "* There cannot exist elements in the domain with no corresponding value in the codomain. \n",
    "* There cannot exist two elements in the codomain corresponding to the same element of the domain. \n",
    "* There may be elements in the codomain with no corresponding element in the source set. \n",
    "* There may be elements in the codomain with more than one corresponding element in the source set. \n",
    "* The set of elements of the codomain that have a corresponding element in the domain is called the image of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3'>Partial functions</font></b><br/>\n",
    "A relation that isn’t defined for all elements of the domain but that fulfills the rest of the requirement (<font color='brown'>no element of the domain can have a relationship with more than one element of the codomain</font>) is often called a <b><font color='darkblue'>partial function</font></b>. The relation predecessor(x) is a partial function on <i>N</i> (<font color='brown'>the set of positive integers plus 0</font>), but it’s a total function on N*, which is the set of positive integers without 0, and its codomain is N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial functions are important in programming because many bugs are the result of using a partial function as if it were a total one. For example, the relation <font color='blue'>f(x) = 1/x</font> is a partial function from N to Q (<font color='brown'>the rational numbers</font>) because it isn’t defined for 0. It’s a total function from N* to Q, but it’s also a total function from N to (<font color='brown'>Q plus error</font>). <b>By adding an element to the codomain</b> (<font color='brown'>the error condition</font>)<b>, you can transform the partial function into a total one.</b> But to do this, the function needs a way to return an error. Can you see an analogy with computer programs? You’ll see that turning partial functions into total ones is an important part of functional programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3'>Function composition </font></b><br/>\n",
    "Functions are building blocks that can be composed to build other functions. The composition of functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> is noted as <b><font color='blue'>f ˚ g</font></b>, which reads as <b>f round g</b>. If f(x) = x + 2 and g(x) = x * 2, then:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f ˚ g (x) = f(g(x)) = f(x * 2) = (x * 2) + 2  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the two notations f ˚ g (x) and f(g(x)) are equivalent. But writing a composition as f(g(x)) implies using x as a placeholder for the argument. Using the f ˚ g notation, you can express a function composition without using this placeholder. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you apply this function to 5, you’ll get the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f ˚ g (5) = f(g(5)) = f(5 * 2) = 10 + 2 = 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s interesting to note that f ˚ g is generally different from g ˚ f, although they may sometimes be equivalent. For example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "g ˚ f (5) = g(f(5)) = g(5 + 2) = 7 * 2 = 14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3'>Functions of several arguments</font></b><br/>\n",
    "So far, we’ve talked only about functions of one argument. What about functions of several arguments? Simply said, there’s no such thing as a function of several arguments. Remember the definition? <b>A function is a relation between a source set and a target set. It isn’t a relation between two or more source sets and a target set. A function can’t have several arguments. But the product of two sets is itself a set, so a function from such a product of sets into a set may appear to be a function of several arguments</b>. Let’s consider the following function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(x, y) = x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "This may be a relation between N x N and N, in which case, it’s a function. But it has only one argument, which is an element of N x N. N x N is the set of all possible pairs of integers. An element of this set is a pair of integers, and a pair is a special case of the more general tuple concept used to represent combinations of several elements. A pair is a tuple of two elements. \n",
    "Tuples are noted between parentheses, so (3, 5) is a tuple and an element of N x N. The function <i>f</i> can be applied to this tuple: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "f((3, 5)) = 3 + 5 = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a case, you may, by convention, simplify writing by removing one set of parentheses: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(3, 5) = 3 + 5 = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it’s still a function of one tuple, and not a function of two arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3'>Function currying</font></b><br/>\n",
    "Functions of tuples can be thought of differently. The function <font color='blue'>f(3, 5)</font> might be considered as a function from N to a set of functions of N. So the previous example could be rewritten as:<br/>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(x)(y) = g(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where\n",
    "```python\n",
    "g(y) = x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "In such a case, you can write\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(x) = g\n",
    "```\n",
    "which means that the result of applying the function <i>f</i> to the argument x is a new function <i>g</i>. Applying this <i>g</i> function to y gives the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "g(y) = x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "When applying <i>g</i>, x is no longer a variable. It doesn’t depend on the argument or on anything else. It’s a constant. If you apply this to (3, 5), you get the following: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(3)(5) = g(5) = 3 + 5 = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "<b>The only new thing here is that the codomain of <i>f</i> is a set of functions instead of a set of numbers. The result of applying f to an integer is a function. The result of applying this function to an integer is an integer.</b> <font color='blue'>f(x)(y)</font> is the curried form of the function <font color='blue'>f(x, y)</font>. Applying this transformation to a function of a tuple (<font color='brown'>which you can call a function of several arguments if you prefer</font>) is called <font color='darkblue'><b>currying</b></font>, after the mathematician Haskell Curry (<font color='brown'>although he wasn’t the inventor of this transformation</font>). \n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3'>Partially applied functions</font></b><br/>\n",
    "The curried form of the addition function may not seem natural, and you might wonder if it corresponds to something in the real world. After all, <b>with the curried version, you’re considering both arguments separately. One of the arguments is considered first, and applying the function to it gives you a new function</b>. Is this new function useful by itself, or is it simply a step in the global calculation? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of an addition, it doesn’t seem useful. And by the way, you could start with either of the two arguments and it would make no difference. The intermediate function would be different, but not the end result. Now consider a new function of a pair of values: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(rate, price) = price / 100 * (100 + rate)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That function seems to be equivalent to this: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "g(price, rate) = price / 100 * (100 + rate)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now consider the curried versions of these two functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(rate)(price)  \n",
    "g(price)(rate)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are functions. But what are <font color='blue'>f(rate)</font> and <font color='blue'>g(price)</font>? Yes, for sure, they’re the results of applying <i>f</i> to rate and <i>g</i> to price. But what are the types of these results? <font color='blue'>f(rate)</font> is a function of a price to a price. If rate = 9, this function applies a tax of 9% to a price, giving a new price. You could call the resulting function <font color='blue'>apply9-percentTax(price)</font>, and it would probably be a useful tool because the tax rate doesn’t change often. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, <font color='blue'>g(price)</font> is a function of a rate to a price. If the price is $100, it gives a new function applying a price of $100 to a variable tax. What could you call this function? If you can’t think of a meaningful name, that usually means that it’s useless, though this depends on the problem you have to solve. Functions like <font color='blue'>f(rate)</font> and <font color='blue'>g(price)</font> are sometimes called <font color='darkblue'><b>partially applied functions</b></font>, in reference to the forms <font color='blue'>f(rate, price)</font> and <font color='blue'>g(price, rate)</font>. <b>Partially applying functions can have huge consequences regarding argument evaluation.</b> We’ll come back to this subject in a later section. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3'>Functions have no effects</font></b><br/>\n",
    "Remember that pure functions only return a value and do nothing else. They don’t mutate any element of the outside world (<font color='brown'>with outside being relative to the function itself</font>), they don’t mutate their arguments, and they don’t explode (<font color='brown'>or throw an exception, or anything else</font>) <b>if an error occurs.
