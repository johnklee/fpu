    "You now have all the types of functions you’ll need. As you saw in the <b><a href='http://localhost/jforum/posts/list/4070.page'>previous chapter</a></b>, these functions don’t require any exceptions to the traditional Java coding rules. Using methods as pure functions (<font color='brown'>a.k.a. functional methods</font>) is perfectly in line with most so-called Java best practices. You haven’t changed the rules or added any exotic constructs. You’ve just added <b>some restrictions about what functional methods can do: they can return a value, and that’s all. They can’t mutate any objects or references in the enclosing scope, nor their arguments. In the first part of this chapter, you’ll learn how to apply the same principles to Java control structures</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>In the second part of this chapter, you’ll learn how to abstract collection operations and control structures to use the power of functions.</b> The last part of the chapter presents techniques that will allow you to get the most out of the type system when handling business problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "# <font color='darkblue'>Making standard control structures functional </font>\n",
    "<b>Control structures are the main building blocks of imperative programming</b>. No imperative Java programmer would believe it’s possible to write programs without using if ... else, switch ... case, and for, while, and do loops. These structures are the essence of imperative programming. But in the following chapters, you’ll learn how to write functional programs with absolutely no control structures. <b>In this section, you’ll be less adventurous—we’ll only look at using the traditional control structures in a more functional style.</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "One point you learned in <a href='https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/functional-programming-in/9781617292736/kindle_split_009.html#ch02'><b>chapter 2</b></a> is that purely functional methods can’t do anything but return a value. They can’t mutate an object or reference in the enclosing scope. The value returned by a method can depend only on its arguments, although the method can read data in the enclosing scope. In such a case, the data is considered to be implicit arguments. In imperative programming, control structures define a scope in which they generally do something, which means they have an effect. This effect might be visible only inside the scope of the control structure, or it might be visible in the enclosing scope. The control structures might also access the enclosing scope to read values. The following listing shows a basic example of email validation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "emailPtn = re.compile('^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\\\\.[a-z]{2,4}$')\n",
    "\n",
    "def testMail(email):\n",
    "    if emailPtn.match(email):\n",
    "        sendVerificationMail(email)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        logError('Email {} is invalid'.format(email))\n",
    "\n",
    "def sendVerificationMail(email):\n",
    "    print('Verification mail is sent to {}'.format(email))\n",
    "\n",
    "def logError(msg):\n",
    "    print('Error msg: {}'.format(msg))\n",
    "```\n",
    "<b><font color='darkblue'>Listing 3.1. Simple email validation</font> </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "# <font color='darkblue'>Abstracting control structures </font>\n",
    "The code in listing 3.1 is purely imperative. You’ll never find such code in functional programming. <b>Although the <font color='blue'>testMail</font> method seems to be a pure effect because it doesn’t return anything, it mixes data processing with effects. This is something you want to avoid, because it results in code that’s impossible to test.</b> Let’s see how you can clean this up. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The first thing you may want to do is separate computation and effects so you can test the computation result</b>. This could be done imperatively, but I prefer to use a function, as shown in the following listing.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "emailPtn = re.compile('^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\\\\.[a-z]{2,4}$')\n",
    "# Compose email checker as a external function for testing\n",
    "emailChecker = lambda e: emailPtn.match(e)\n",
    "\n",
    "def testMail(email):\n",
    "    if emailChecker(email):\n",
    "        sendVerificationMail(email)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        logError('Email {} is invalid'.format(email))\n",
    "```\n",
    "<b><font color='darkblue'>Listing 3.2. Using a function to validate the email </font></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can test the data processing part of the program (<font color='brown'>validating the email string</font>) because you’ve clearly separated it from the effects. But you still have many problems. One is that you handle only the case where the string doesn’t validate. But if the string received is None, a <font color='blue'><b>TypeError</b></font>  is thrown. Consider the following example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "testMail(\"john.doe@acme.com\");\n",
    "testMail(None);\n",
    "testMail(\"paul.smith@acme.com\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "The third line won’t be executed, even though the email address is valid, because the NPE thrown by the second line kills the thread. It would be better to get a logged message indicating what happened, and to continue processing the next address. Another problem appears if you receive an empty string: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "testMail(\"\");  \n",
    "```\n",
    "This won’t cause an error, but the address won’t validate, and the following message will be logged:\n",
    "> <font color='green'>email is invalid.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The double space (between “email” and “is”) indicates that the string was empty. A specific message would be better, such as this: \n",
    "> <font color='green'>email must not be empty.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these problems, we define a class <font color='blue'><b>Result</b></font> to handle this kind of case. So you can write your new version of the program:"
